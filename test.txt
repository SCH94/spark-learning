What you do with your career is your own decision.
This book tells you how I improved my life by quitting my job, and creating a sustainable and growing income through self-employment. What I learned along the way could help you do the same.
But no matter how much advice or how many stories I give you, in the end success relies on your own preparation, planning, skillset, talents, determination, and a little bit of luck. I can't give all of that to you.
If this book gives you the confidence to strike out on your own – that’s great. But do it responsibly, and realize that failure is a very real possibility that you must plan for.
Don't blame me for the decisions you make; they are ultimately your own.
Now, on with the adventure.
